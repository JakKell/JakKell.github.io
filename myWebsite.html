			<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			<p>Music is definitely one of the most important aspects of my life.
			I love listening to music and finding new artists whose sound resonates with me.
			Recently I’ve been listening to a lot of Good Kid, an indie rock band whose songs sound great on the road.
			I also listen to a lot of Ginger Root, a band that draws inspiration from pop and funk and whose songs I have a hard time pinning
			down into a genre.
			I also am a big fan of animation and animated cartoons.
			The Owl House has to be my favorite animated TV show. Its creative world loveable characters really capture my imagination.
			I am also a big fan of the Ghibli film Howl’s Moving Castle. The animation is stunning and the story is captivatng.
			I also am a huge nerd when it comes to games, both table top and video.
			My favorite video game has got to be Splatoon with its bright and bold presentation combined with fast and fluid gameplay.
			I’m also a fan of Magic: The Gathering for its strategic depth and endless options with deckbuilding.
